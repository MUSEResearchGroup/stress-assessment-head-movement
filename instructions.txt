Please, follow this instructions before running the scripts:

1) After downloading and unzipping the repository, unzip the dataset folder "Head Movement Dataset" and place it in the same folder as the other scripts.

2) To run MATLAB scripts, the following toolboxes must be installed:
	- Signal processing Toolbox
	- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

3) stats_ANOVA.m, phaseStress_Classifier.m, testStressClassifier, and nasa_results.m make use of the functions getFeatures_fixed.m, getFeatures_MA.m, and hypothesis_check.m and of the MATLAB data trained_models_unw.mat. Please, make sure that these are in the same folder as the scripts before running them.

After these steps, these scripts can be run without further requirements.

4) Install python???

5) stats_WelchANOVA.py uses the data in the folder Stats-Stroop STFT. Please make sure that Stats-Stroop STFT is in the same folder as the script before running it.
